## Tools Used
- Cursor: Helping to write code

## How I Used AI

1. **Initial scaffolding**: [Describe]
2. **Component generation**: I used AI to help design and implement chart components, including fixing some bugs in their functionality and appearance. The mock-data is settled with the help of AI (Because I wanted to make the values very clear according the to logic)
3. **Bug fixing**: AI assisted in identifying and resolving issues within the chart components.
4. **Code review**: [Describe]

## Manual Work
- I build the basic structure and theme.
- Most of the dashboard’s overall design and non-chart components were developed manually by me.
- I chose to implement these parts myself to ensure custom styling and meet specific requirements.
